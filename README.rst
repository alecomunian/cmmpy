A python implementation of the Comparison Model Method (CMM).


Purpose
--------------

This is a python implementation of the Comparison Model Method (CMM), a direct method to solve inverse problems in hydrogeology,
and in particular to compute the hydraulic conductivity *T* of a confined aquifer given an initial tentative value of
*T* and one or more interpolated hydraulic head fields *h*.
In particular, this version of the CMM heavily relies on the USGS engines of the Modflow family (and Modflof6 in particular) to
solve the forward problem.
