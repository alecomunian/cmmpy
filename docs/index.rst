`cmmpy` documentation
==================================

Welcome to the `cmmpy`'s documentation, a Python implementation of the
comparison model method (CMM), a **direct** inversion method to obtain the
hydraulic transmissivity :math:`T` of an aquifer.

This is the accompanying software of the manuscript "Improving the
robustness of the Comparison Model Method for the identification of
hydraulic transmissivities", by A.Comunian and M.Giudici, published on
Computers and Geosciences - DOI: `10.1016/j.cageo.2021.104705
